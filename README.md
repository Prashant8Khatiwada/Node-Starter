## Topics

### Node.js Basics

#### Handling HTTP Requests

#### Importing Core Modules

- `http` is used to create the server
- `fs` is used for file operations

#### Creating a Server

- The `http.createServer()` method initializes a server that listens to incoming requests and never finishes by default

#### Routing

##### Root Route (/)

- Serves an HTML form for users to submit a message
- Handles GET requests and responds with an HTML document

##### Setting Headers and HTML Content

- Adds `Content-Type: text/html` to the response header for HTML output
- Uses `res.write()` to send HTML content

```const http = require('http');
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  res.write('<html>');
  res.write('<head><title>Hello Node.js</title></head>');
  res.write('<body><h1>Hello from Node.js!</h1></body>');
  res.write('</html>');
  res.end();
```

##### Ending the Response

- Uses `res.end()` to finalize the response after sending data

#### Starting the Server

##### Listening on a Port

- Starts the server on port 5000 using `server.listen()`
- Logs a confirmation message once the server is running
